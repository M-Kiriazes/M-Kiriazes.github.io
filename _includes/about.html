        <p class="text-white-50">
          Cybersecurity analyst with a passion for system defense, vulnerability assessment, and cyber forensics. With experience in competitive defense challenges and real-world simulations, I specialize in detecting threats, analyzing compromised systems, and responding to incidents under pressure. I hold a Computer Science Bachelor's degree with a concentration in Information Assurance & Cybersecurity and a minor in Social Sciences from Tennessee Technological University, and a Computer Science Associate's Degree from Columbia State Community College. I’ve competed nationally in cyber defense events and developed tools for military-grade environments. As a proven instructor in competitive marching arts, I’ve led and mentored large groups with an emphasis on precision, clarity, and performance under pressure—skills I bring into every cybersecurity challenge I take on.
